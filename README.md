# Front-End Projects Showcase

Welcome to my Front-End Projects repository! This collection features a variety of coding projects that highlight my skills and experience in building interactive, responsive, and visually appealing web applications using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and more.

## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- **HTML & CSS**: Well-structured and styled web pages, demonstrating my understanding of layout, design principles, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and dynamic elements, showcasing my ability to bring static pages to life.
- **Other Technologies**: As I continue to grow as a developer, I will add projects involving other front-end technologies and frameworks to this repo.

## Goals:
- To demonstrate my front-end development capabilities.
- To continually improve and expand my coding skills.
- To contribute to open-source and collaborate on new projects in the future.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions. Contributions and collaborations are always welcome!
