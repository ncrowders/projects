# Build a Roman Numeral Converter

This project is part of the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) from freeCodeCamp. The goal was to build a Roman Numeral Converter using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview

Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. These symbols can be combined in various ways to represent different Arabic numerals (the standard numbering system). This project is designed to convert an Arabic numeral to its Roman numeral equivalent.

### Project Objective
- Create a function that takes an Arabic numeral (integer) as input and returns its Roman numeral representation.
- Ensure the solution handles numerals in the range from 1 to 3999.

## Key Technologies

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the page and providing visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the functionality of the Roman numeral conversion.

## JavaScript Concepts Covered
In this project, you’ll apply various fundamental and advanced JavaScript concepts, including:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to store and manipulate data.
- **Arrays and Objects**: Store Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values in arrays or objects.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Iterate through numerals and apply rules to convert to Roman numerals.
- **Functions**: Break down the problem into smaller, reusable pieces of code.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Create a user interface to allow input and display the result interactively.

## Project Requirements

The Roman numeral converter must fulfill the following requirements:
- Convert any number from 1 to 3999 into its Roman numeral equivalent.
- Ensure that the result is accurate and follows standard Roman numeral conventions (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).
- The user should be able to input a number and see the converted result.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Mapping Roman numerals**: We map each Roman numeral symbol (I, V, X, etc.) to its corresponding integer value.
2. **Conversion Process**: We iterate over the input integer, subtracting values and appending the correct Roman numeral symbols until we’ve fully converted the number.
